Did you have fun?

Were you able to participate in the music? 







Hey friends, long time no post! I've been inspired recently by some of the content ya'll have been pushing out and wanted to fan the flames by sharing some exciting things that are happening this year.

1. Megan and I are getting back on the horse with couchtime. Woo! This is the most fun I've had making music in many years and it feels great to grease up the wheels. We're shifting the format slightly to focus more on the fun parts, so tune in over here if you're looking for a cute and jazzy time.

2. On a similar but totally mad note, I've decided challenge myself to making 100 songs in Ableton this year. I'm posting them to my website with small reflections that I can use for curiosities sake later.
