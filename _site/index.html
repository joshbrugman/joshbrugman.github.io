Yikes. I have a long way to go before this project is sustainable. 😅 This little dance track took me upwards of 10 hours, many of which I don’t think actually contributed to the song in a meaningful way.
I spent a lot of time being indecisive, and sunk a lot of energy into details and B characters (like complex hat delays) before fully establishing the main elements.
In the end a lot of that detail work was cut because it either competed with, or wasn't in service of the overall indentity of the song.

Writing the next track on my laptop speakers in mono until It feels finished. Then monitors, then stereo.
