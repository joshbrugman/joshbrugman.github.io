Less than ten hours this time but I scrapped 3 or 4 songs before this was done. It's clear already that Ableton isn't the problem, commiting to musical ideas is.
The drums are audio, sequenced by hand which seemed to work well because I was forced to hear what I wanted before just diving in.
Best moment was taking out sections of guitar and hearing the song get bigger.

Writing in mono really helped. I caught myself mixing too early a couple times. I didn't apply any fx to the guitar or bass until all the parts were in. Definitely the move.
I'm going to commit to my first idea next time even if it's garbage.

Yikes. I have a long way to go before this project is sustainable. 😅 This little dance track took me upwards of 10 hours, many of which I don’t think actually contributed to the song in a meaningful way.
I spent a lot of time being indecisive, and sunk a lot of energy into details and B characters (like complex hat delays) before fully establishing the main elements.
In the end a lot of that detail work was cut because it either competed with, or wasn't in service of the overall indentity of the song.

Writing the next track on my laptop speakers in mono until It feels finished. Then monitors, then stereo.
