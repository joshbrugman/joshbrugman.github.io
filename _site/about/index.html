    <p>
        Bop Hour is the public accountability measure for a musical challenge.
        I'm making 100 songs in Ableton Live this year.
        My primary goal is to outpace the destructive black hole that is creative preciousness.

        Each sketch needs to have a clear emotional identity, be at least 2 minutes,
        and have no more than 3 primary elements. All tempos genres and atmospheres are on the table.

          My name is Josh Brugman. I make music and am fortunate to collaborate
          with some of my best friends.
        </p> 

        <p>
        I’m in love with one of them and we live
        together in Portland Oregon.

      The name Bop Hour was originally a thoughtless placeholder for a folder 
      that would hold absolutely inconsequential Ableton projects. Eventually 
      it just wasn’t a placeholder anymore and now it’s the name of the blog.
