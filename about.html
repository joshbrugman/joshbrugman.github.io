    <p>
        Bop Hour is the public accountability measure for a musical challenge:
        to write <strong> 100 songs in Ableton Live this year.</strong> I'm posting them here as they're finished, for better or worse.
        This is a total experiment. The goal is to outrun my own creative preciousness, which has become a destructive black hole full of unfinished, unfocused songs. 
    </p>   
    <p>   
        The requirements are each sketch needs to have a clear emotional identity, be at least 2 minutes, and have no more than 3 primary elements.
        All tempos, genres, and atmospheres are on the table.

          My name is Josh Brugman. I make music and am fortunate to collaborate
          with some of my closest friends. One of them I'm in love with and we live
          together in Portland Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two of us host another project called Couchtime where we attempt
          to write jazz songs on our couch in 60 minutes. It's an absurdly
          fun and chaotic time. Swing by our <a href="https://instagram.com/itscouchtime" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and say hi!

      The name Bop Hour was originally a thoughtless placeholder for a folder 
      that would hold absolutely inconsequential Ableton projects. Eventually 
      it decided not to be a placeholder and became the name of this blog instead.
